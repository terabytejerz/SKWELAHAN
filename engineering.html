    <h1>Welcome to College of Engineering and Architecture.</h1><br><br>

    <h2>College of Engineering and Architecture(CEA)</h2><br>
    <p>The Colegio de Cosme(CdC) School of Engineering and Architecture (CEA) nurtures academic excellence and develops graduate outcomes through the adoption of Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) in its program offerings.<br><br><br>
    The CdC-VMO mandates the direction of the CEA mission and objectives in collaboration with different stakeholders for the attainment of Program Educational Objectives (PEOs). The PEOs are used for the development of the Program Outcomes (POs). The POs guide the desired course learning objectives and student outcomes through the implementation of outcomes-based teaching and learning (OBTL). PEOs, POs, CLOs, SOs, and OBTL undergoes assessment and evaluation for the improvement of the programs.

    CEA provides exercises that adopt the real workplace setting. Students train in both local and international firms which include SMART Communications, CISCO Networking Academy, Bentley Systems Philippines, Texas Instruments, Pointwest Technologies, PLDT, and Hinduja Global Solutions Ltd.
</p>

    <h2>Courses</h2>
    <p>Prospective enrollees can choose from the following programs:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">

<li>j.know contemporary issues</li>
<li>k.use techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for architecture practice</li>
<li>l.know and understand architecture and management principles as members and leaders in a team to manage projects in multidisciplinary environments</li>
</ul>
        <li><a>Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering</a><li>
            <img src="engineer.jpg">
            <p>The career paths available to civil engineers are many and varied and can involve a wide range of activities, tools, situations, and venues, from conceptual design of facilities that do not yet exist to forensic study of facilities that have failed to perform as expected and advanced simulation of complex systems, management of people and projects, and private consulting to public service.<br><br>

            A civil engineer must be prepared for a career that traverses this considerable professional breadth as well as for a career focused on a single professional activity. The BSCE curriculum is designed specifically to meet this educational challenge by emphasizing fundamental knowledge, transferable skills, and lifelong learning.</p>

<h5>PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES</h5>
<p>Within five years after graduation, graduates of the architecture program have:<p>
